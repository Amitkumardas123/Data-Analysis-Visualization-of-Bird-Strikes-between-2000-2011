# Data-Analysis-Visualization-of-Bird-Strikes-between-2000-2011\
A bird strike is strictly defined as a collision between a bird and an aircraft which is in flight or on a take-off or landing roll. The term is often expanded to cover other wildlife strikes - with bats or ground animals. Bird Strike is common and can be a significant threat to aircraft safety. For smaller aircraft, significant damage may be caused to the aircraft structure and all aircraft, especially jet-engine ones, are vulnerable to the loss of thrust which can follow the ingestion of birds into engine air intakes. This has resulted in several fatal accidents. Bird strikes may occur during any phase of flight, but are most likely during the take-off, initial climb, approach and landing phases due to the greater numbers of birds in flight at lower levels.

# Overview

This project is focused on analyzing bird strike incidents involving aircraft across various states and airports in the United States. The analysis covers multiple aspects including the frequency of strikes, the effect of strikes on flight operations, the conditions during strikes, and the associated costs. Visualizations and insights derived from the data aim to improve understanding and potentially inform preventive measures in aviation safety.

# Introduction

Bird strikes pose a significant risk to aviation, potentially leading to costly repairs, flight delays, and in extreme cases, accidents. This project delves into bird strike data to identify patterns and trends, offering valuable insights into how and when these incidents occur. By understanding these factors, stakeholders can better strategize to mitigate risks.

# Data

The dataset used in this project contains detailed records of bird strike incidents, including variables such as:

Aircraft Type & Model: Information about the aircraft involved.

Location: The state and airport where the incident occurred.

Flight Phase: The phase of flight during which the strike happened (e.g., takeoff, landing).

Altitude: The altitude of the aircraft at the time of the strike.

Effect on Flight: The impact of the strike on flight operations.

Costs: Financial impact related to the strike.

# Features

Top 50 Airports by Bird Strikes: Visualization showing the airports with the highest number of bird strike incidents.

Airlines with Most Bird Strikes: Analysis and visualization of the top 10 airlines encountering bird strikes.

Yearly Cost Analysis: Line chart depicting the annual cost incurred due to bird strikes.

Phase of Flight Analysis: Pie chart showing the distribution of strikes across different flight phases.

Altitude Analysis: Donut chart representing the altitude of aircraft during strikes.

Pilot Warnings: Analysis of the relation between prior bird warnings and the effects of strikes.

Effect of Strikes by Altitude: Bar charts detailing the effect of strikes at different altitude levels.

# Usage

This project is intended for data scientists, aviation safety analysts, and anyone interested in understanding bird strike incidents. It can be used as a foundation for further analysis or to inform safety protocols in the aviation industry.
